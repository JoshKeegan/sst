# GNOME-shell Type Definitions

Type definitions can be added under this dir to represent [gnome-shell JS](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/-/tree/main/js) that we want to interact with.  

To give this structure, the file structure mimics that of gnome-shell (i.e. .../ui/main.js => ./ui/main/d/ts).

These were introduced as part of the [migration of extensions to ESM for GNOME 45](https://gjs.guide/extensions/upgrading/gnome-shell-45.html).
